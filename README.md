# cows-n-bulls-game
Using python, created a game where you are guessing a 4 digit number and receive a hint after each guess

for each correct digit in the correct place, you recieve a cow
for each correct digit in the wrong place, you recieve a bull
you win when you get 4 cows (or guess the complete number)

if the number to guess is 1234
7124 will give you 2 bulls and 1 cow, as you guessed three of the digits correctly, but two are in the wrong place
